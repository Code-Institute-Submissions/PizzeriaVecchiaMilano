## Installation

In the head of the project I have installed the links to have access to different libraries. 
![head](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OmarBedawi/PizzeriaVecchiaMilano/master/assets/images/readMe_files/1head&mail.png?raw=true)

1. Bootstap 4: a library with templates for buttons, forms, jumbotrons and so many other components. For this project for example I used it to build the responsive navigation bar and the green button on the navabar.
1. Font Awesome: is an icon library. 
1. Cdnjs is a Javascript library and below the external link to the style.css file.
1. In the <head> of the orderonline page there is the link to connect to the sendEmailJs service.
  This service, every time an order is sent, make sure to send an email with the order to the pizzeria, and a confirmation email to the customer.
1. At the bottom of the page is where the javascript files are located. In every page html page for example there is the <script> to make the navbar responsive for every screen size.

## User Stories

I built a responsive navbar, that shows a toggle menu when the screen size is below 991px. 
To build it I followed an accurate and guided tutorial that you can find at this [link](https://youtu.be/gt8zOLQ8A0w)

The homepage presents a carousel with pictures followed by the awards won by the pizzeria and a google map.

The menu page gives the possibility to see the pizza that you desire when you click on the button below every pizza: infact an image of the relative pizza, will appear.
Same thing happen with every dessert.

The ourstory page is telling a piece of history of the pizzeria. At the bottom of the page there is also a short video of the staff in action.

The gallery page is a collection of pictures shared by the pizzeria staff and the customers.

The order on-line page is for who want a home delivery or to pick up at the pizzeria.

The CSS file is divided by comments, that I used as title to separate the html pages or elements like map and carousel and the different screen sizes.

This make any future correction or research much easier.

The project presents two little bugs that I still need to correct:
