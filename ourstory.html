            <h1>WHO WE ARE</h1>
            <p>Vecchia Milano was initially born as a winery, and then at the end of the 1980s it became a place for tasting, not only wines, 
               but also traditional foods, so much that it became a pizzeria.<br>
               In the years to follow, Vecchia Milano specialized more and more as a pizzeria, continuing in the direction of the best tradition of Italian pizza.

            <h1>HOW WE WORK</h1>
            <p id="justifyText">
               The new frontier of Vecchia Milano is the use of refined ingredients of the highest quality such as flours from organic farming, 
               vegetables and flavorings.
               Taking advantage of the many raw materials that the Campania region offers throughout the year and constantly continuing to search 
               for the best Italian gastronomic excellence.
               The integration of the ingredients and their mixing on the pizza allows Vecchia Milano to create new proposals and continuously 
               update the menu.
               The queen of pizza is type 1 flour, less refined and rich in fiber, vitamins and minerals that make the dough particularly 
               nutritious and highly digestible, an irreplaceable quality in a respecting Italian pizza. After the process, 
               we let the dough rise for 48 hours at room temperature without altering its natural leavening.
            </p>
            <h1>A SUCCESSFUL STORY</h1>
            <p>Vecchia Milano is proposed as a place for comparison, exchange, meetings and debates.<br>
               This place, formerly home of the Academy of Pizza, in June 2016 was awarded by the International School of Italian Cuisine 
               ALMA Master of Art and Crafts, in the presence of the Minister of Cultural Heritage, awarded as World Luxury Restaurant and  won the "Exellent service award" in 2018.
